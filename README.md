### Develop
npm install inside main directory && inside the client folder.

To integrate a new module into the app:
  - In Store.js, import reducer and put it into combineReducers
  - In App.jsx, import the view/component and put it in the viewPath array

To run the app, use `npm run start:dev` command in root folder, which will start Express API server and React development server simultaneously.
